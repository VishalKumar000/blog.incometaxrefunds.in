During my B.Tech journey, I dove into full-stack development, gaining experience through internships. Now, as a full-time React developer, I'm eager to tackle exciting projects and keep growing in this field. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am also familiar with TypeScript. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and playing with my dog. I also enjoy learning new things. I am currently learning about SEO optimization. I'm also learning how to play the chess.
